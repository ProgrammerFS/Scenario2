# Scenario2 - Set Master

**Set master** is a Venn diagram/set notation helper for students that are studying computer science or mathematics. It has various components that help students better understand set notations, such as the visual representation of Venn diagrams and quizzes on set notations to test their understanding.

For this project, we used **Flask** to develop the web application in Python. Additionally, we also used **HTML** and **CSS** to style the website. Other libraries such as Matplotlib were used to create the visualisation of the Venn diagrams.

*To run this project:* 

​	Run file `run.py` or type `python3 run.py` in the terminal.

​	Then, enter `http://127.0.0.1:9888/login` in your browser.
